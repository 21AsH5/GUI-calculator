# GUI-calculator
I did my First experiment Calculator(Graphical user Interface) on TKinter module python 

ash- refernce variable for calling Tk() function 

 #equation=equation[:-1]   won't work for StringVar()
 #entry1.delete(0)         deletes the first number
   
   
  I'll be updating it with bg_image soon
